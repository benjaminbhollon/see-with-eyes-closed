I care about your privacy. I promise that no matter what you do on this website, I will be doing the most I possibly can to ensure your safety.

I only collect information you give me with the understanding that I will store it and only use it for the reason you give it to me.

I don't use any creepy trackers or analytics programs to gather information about you. The only information I gather without explicit user input is how many people visit each article, and this is 100% anonymous data.

That being said, I may have to use scripts from other websites on occasion that do collect information. This privacy policy does not apply to them and you should see their individual privacy policies. If you worry about these websites, I recommend installing some sort of blocker for their trackers. I recommend [Brave Browser](https://brave.com), which automatically blocks all ads and trackers.

Here are the third-party services I am aware of using at the time of this writing:

- Revue
- Cloudflare
- Youtube
- Github Buttons
- Goodreads Widgets
- Google reCAPTCHA

I am actively working to reduce the number of third-party services I use and will do my best to update this list as information changes, though I make no guarantees of its accuracy.

If you have any concerns about your data or privacy, please [contact me](/contact/) and I'll try to assist you.
